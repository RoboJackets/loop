Once a check has posted to Mercury, the corresponding :doc:`expense payment </workday/expense-payments>` can be synced to QuickBooks as an invoice payment.

All :doc:`Engage purchase requests </reimbursement-requests/engage-purchase-requests>` and :doc:`email requests </reimbursement-requests/email-requests>` associated with the payment must be synced to QuickBooks before the expense payment, so it can be applied to the corresponding invoices.

Mercury transactions can be refreshed using the :guilabel:`Refresh Mercury Transactions` action in the :guilabel:`Bank Transactions` list.
Check deposits should automatically link to the matching expense payment.

On the expense payment details page, use the :guilabel:`Sync to QuickBooks` action to create the invoice payment in QuickBooks.

The check number is used as the payment reference number, and the Mercury posting date is used as the payment date.

Review the payment in QuickBooks after syncing to ensure the invoice links are correct.
