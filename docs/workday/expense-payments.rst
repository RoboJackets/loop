:og:description: Once an expense report is approved, Workday will automatically create an expense payment.

Expense payments
================

.. vale Google.Passive = NO
.. vale Google.Will = NO
.. vale write-good.E-Prime = NO
.. vale write-good.Passive = NO
.. vale write-good.TooWordy = NO

Once an :doc:`expense report <expense-reports>` is approved, Workday will automatically create an expense payment.
If there are multiple expense reports approved within 1-2 business days of each other, they will be grouped into a single expense payment.

Expense payments link to a Mercury bank transaction.
Once the bank transaction posts, the expense payment can be synced to QuickBooks as a :doc:`invoice payment </quickbooks/payments>`.
