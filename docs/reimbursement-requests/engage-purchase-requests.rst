Engage purchase requests
========================

As of fall 2023, reimbursement requests are submitted to the Student Organization Finance Office via `Anthology Engage <https://gatech.campuslabs.com/engage/finance/robojackets/requests/purchase>`_.

Data load
---------

Engage data must be uploaded with the `loop-engage-upload <https://github.com/RoboJackets/loop-engage-upload>`_ utility by a member with access to the Finance module in Engage.
The footer at the bottom of Nova shows when Engage data was most recently uploaded.

Invoicing
---------

Engage purchase requests may be loaded to QuickBooks as :doc:`invoices </quickbooks/invoices>` when an :doc:`expense report </workday/expense-reports>` has been associated, or when the status is :guilabel:`Approved` and the step is :guilabel:`Check Request Sent`.

The Engage purchase request number is used as the invoice number, and the request submission date is used as the invoice date.
