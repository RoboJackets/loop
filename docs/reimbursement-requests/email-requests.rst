Email requests
==============

Email requests are used to log reimbursement requests submitted to departments that don't use Engage.
Since fall 2023, this includes the School of Mechanical Engineering.

Data load
---------
Email requests must be created via email by either blind carbon copying or forwarding emails to `ingest@loop.robojackets.org <mailto:ingest@loop.robojackets.org>`_.
Attachments are automatically extracted and created as individual email requests.

Loop will attempt to extract basic information from the attachment using `Sensible <https://www.sensible.so/>`_.
The data may also be manually cleaned within Nova if needed.

.. note::
   ZIP files aren't supported -- email attachments must be individual PDFs or images.

Invoicing
---------

Email requests may be loaded to QuickBooks as :doc:`invoices </quickbooks/invoices>` at any time.

Loop assigns an internal email request ID number, which is prefixed with a department identifier to build the invoice number, for example ME045. The email send date is used as the invoice date.
